One the most powerful functionalities of SPiRA is effectively connecting data to 
cell instances. This examples shows how data from the defined RDD are connected
to a class using parameters. By connecting parameters to a class through a 
field allows the given data to be intersepted and manipulated before fully 
commiting it to the class instance.

**Demonstrates**:

1. How to link process data from the RDD to default parameter values.
2. How to change parameters when creating an instance.
3. How to switch to a different RDD by simply importing a new database file.
4. Add documentation to a specific parameter.

The Rule Deck Database has to be imported before use. Importing a specific 
RDD script will initialize and create the data tree.
