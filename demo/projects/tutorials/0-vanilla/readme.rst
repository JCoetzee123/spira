Layout elementals can be generated using the native scripting approach, similar to 
that of the gdspy library. This approach can be used for quick layout experiments, 
were the connected parameters are not of critical importance.

**Demonstrates**

1. Creating a vanilla layout elemental.
2. Connecting parameters to a cell using Python's dynamic nature.

**Problems**

1. Constraints cannot be placed on parameters.
2. There is no overview places on the parameters that can or should
   connected to a specific instance.
3. Creating hierarchical layouts becomes syntactically tedious.
