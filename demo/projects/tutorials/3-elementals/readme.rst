Now that we have a basic understanding of creating a cell and connecting data to an instance,
we have to add layout elementals to represent GDSII primitives. All elementals defined in the 
`create_elementals` method are automatically added to the instance.

**Demonstrates**:

1. How to add elementals to a cell using the `create_elementals` method.
2. Create a polygon using the framework and add it to the cell.
3. How to use the parameters when creating elementals.
4. How to write to a GDSII file.

Depicted in this example is the three different ways of creating a polygon.
